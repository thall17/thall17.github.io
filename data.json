    "description_1": "Hi! I'm Tim, a full-time Apple quality engineer, software/web developer, and graduate student based in Los Angeles, California. I love creating innovative applications with intuitive designs that can make a positive impact. I'm actively looking for new software opportunities in the Bay Area with a plan to move in early 2018. I'm most experienced in web development - specifically Ruby on Rails - but have worked with many different frameworks and languages, and am always excited to leverage my diverse professional and educational background to develop new skills.",
    "description_2": "One thing you'll notice about me from this page is that I'm always learning. I feel very fortunate to have attended UCLA, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Sociology in 2009. Since then, I've progressed in a career in the tech sector, learning through a combination of independent study, on-the-job experience, and formal educaiton. The opportunities in online education are greater than ever before, and I'm always trying to make the most of it. The MOOC model has allowed me to build a strong foundation in computer science, gain certificates in Ruby on Rails, Python programming, and machine learning from accredited universities, and currently I'm on track to complete the Georgia Tech OMSCS program (MS, Computer Science) degree - specializing in Artificial/Interactive Intelligence and Machine Learning - in 2019. My long-term goal is to complement my growing skillset in software engineering with the statistical analysis, cultural studies, and societal investigation skills I learned at UCLA.",
